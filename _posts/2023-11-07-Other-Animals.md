title: "Other Animals"
---

Sometimes, like when you have parents and grandparents who live on farms, people have animals that aren't pets. Even though they may become food eventually, we still take care of them as best we can and respect them like any other living creature. So, these are the 'pet' honorable mentions.

The Cows (My Parents')

These are 'The Cows', black dexters and dexter-angus crosses. My parents have a dozen now, even though technically they aren't allowed to have that many (don't tell anyone, they're working on downsizing). Many of these cows were named by my sister, who is five, so they've got some pretty funny names. Some of the names are: Milkshake, Mayor McCheese, Cinderellaman, Llama, and Donut (the only female calf so far), while the bull is called Houdini (not by my sister, you can definitely imagine why he's called that). The cows do all have their own personalities, although mainly they're energetic, troublesome, and loud when they think they don't have enough hay. They are, still, tasty.

Grandma's chickens

Here are some of my grandma's chickens, very cute, very clucky, and well, also very tasty. They tend to like caterpillars, blueberries, and grapes.
