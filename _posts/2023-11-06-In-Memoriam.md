Pets are amazing, they're in our lives for a big chunk of time, and they're all unique, lovely, and mean something special to us. But inevitably, pets die, and we miss them, but always remember them. Here I honour some past pets, so that their images will always remain online, in immortality.

My Grandma's past cat, Kiri

Name: Kiri

A little about her: I didn't get to see her too often, but when I did she would always ignore me because she didn't like that there were strange people in her house. I appreciated her anyway, because she was very soft and my stepdad liked her a lot.

Favourite memory: Once, before she knew I was going to be coming around more often, she laid on my lap and we napped together for about an hour. I think some people snuck into the room to get pictures of the adorableness of the kid and cat snoozing. She never did it again, and in fact barely let me pet her, but i'll always remember that time.

The lovers, Caramel and Macchiato

Names: Caramel, the browner one, and Macchiato, the whiter one

A little about them: We had Caramel for a while, but we noticed she was getting lonely when she tried to make friends with Tummy a few times, and Tummy wasn't having it. Eventually we adopted Mac (who we called Mac the Destroyer because of how much he loved digging), and they almost immediately bonded and became inseparable, grooming each other and snuggling up constantly.

Favourite memory: My favourite memory of Caramel was whenever she'd groom my one pair of fluffy pyjama pants, which were cow-print. She really liked it when I wore them, and would let me pet her quite a lot. Mac was never as big a fan of people, but whenever he let me pet him, I made sure to appreciate it.

Katie, the first chatty calico

Name: Katie

A little about her: She was elderly when we adopted her from some coworker's-aunt's-friend's-boss, and for the first little while she hid in the closet from everyone. Eventually she warmed up to us, and even Tummy tolerated her (to this date, the cat Tummy has tolerated most). She loved to make little 'mrrp' sounds, and do what we called 'scorpion tail' when she was really happy to see us.

Favourite memory: Once I was hanging out with her, and she suddenly looked up at me, blepping out her cute little tongue! It was so cute, and I managed to get a few pictures! She never even realized she was doing it, and only put her tongue back in her mouth when my stepdad booped it!

Hummus, the wise and hungry

Name: Hummus (also known as Bundalf)

A little about him: We adopted him from the Glenora vet clinic, only a few blocks from my current apartment, after he managed to tear open a bag of dog food and eat his fill. He was known as the rabbit with the cast iron stomach, and regularly lived up to that title.

Favourite memory: I bought some black licorice for my dad, and stored it under my bed until I was ready to ship it to him. Hummus decided that the only thing to do was climb the stairs, dig out the black licorice, and tear it open and eat it for himself. He turned out fine and unremorseful, and went on to eat other things he really shouldn't have.
