My Pets

![Tummy, the fluffy grey cat](/The-Pet-Blog/IMG_3545(1).jpg)

Name: Tummy (past name Lulu)
Nicknames: Tummer, Floof, Murderfloof
Hobbies: Sleeping in my sock drawer, being annoyed at her new roommate Ronin, being a scaredy-floof
Adopted: From the Edmonton Humane Society as a kitten in 2012
What she means to me: She's been in my life for so long that I can't imagine being home without her, even if she is a crotchety old lady. She was my family's first cat, and showed me how amazing having cats can be.

![Ronin, the long orange noodle boy](/The-Pet-Blog/IMG_3546(1).jpg)
Name: Ronin
Nicknames: Turkey boy, Mr. Boy, Mr. Cheesy Breadstick, Noodle guy
Hobbies: Chirping, knocking over his water dish in a frenzy, trying to play with his new best friend Tummy (and failing)
Adopted: August of this year, from the Edmonton Humane Society
What he means to me: He doubles the joy of having another creature in my small apartment, and is the first cat I've adopted myself, hopefully of many. Tummy sleeps everywhere and I appreciate her, and Ronin runs around and explores and makes sure I play with him all the time, making sure I notice he's here.

My Parents' Pets
![Cinder, the sooty hunter](/The-Pet-Blog/DSCN3443.JPG)
Name: Cinder
Nicknames: Nooten, Mr. Ferocious, Sir Kiddon, Birderer
Hobbies: Catching mice, birds, voles, everything really, forcefully becoming friends with anyone he can (especially his bestest friend ever, Mira), stretching out like he has no bones
Adopted: Nope, found him as a kitten stuck under the floorboards of our barn in 2016
What he taught me: I helped nurse him back to health, so he taught me what rescuing cats is like, and what having an outdoor enthusiast cat is like (my parents live in the country so he has plenty of space to roam, but always comes inside at night. 

![Mira, the calico queen with VERY important opinions](/The-Pet-Blog/IMG_3547.jpg)
Name: Mira (past name Mama)
Nicknames: Mira Mira-cles (like Heracles), chatty chonk, Mistress Mira Many Sounds
Hobbies: Licking crumbs off the floor, forcefully mothering Cinder, taking off her collar, creaking out her **very** important opinions
Adopted: 2020, from her foster family after we lost our previous calico
What she taught me: When it's ok to love again after loss, sometimes people are scary so you need to be gentle with others. Always listen to the cat.

![Buster, the criminal rabbit](/The-Pet-Blog/IMG_3548).jpg)
Name: Buster
Nicknames: Criminal-bun, *Sir* (said respectfully but exasperatedly), hunger-bun
Hobbies: Committing crimes (eating stuff he's not supposed to), being food-aggressive, having the world's most mobile ears, protest-pooping about his new roommate Num
Adopted: 2022, because my mom is a self-proclaimed 'crazy bunny lady'
What he taught me: Always watch out for the small ones, they're the most vicious. Never put anything down that you don't want eaten. Yes, rabbits **can** be criminals

![Num, the teeny soot ball](/The-Pet-Blog/IMG_3549).jpg)
Name: Num (short for Penumbra)
Nicknames: Soot gremlin, partner-in-crime, teeny-ears
Hobbies: Being an accomplice to crime, having invisible ears, stuffing his entire body into hay containers and eating his way out, protest-pooping about his roommate Buster
Adopted: June of 2023, his previous owners didn't know how to take care of him :(
What he taught me: Small doesn't mean innocent, you can find friends in unlikely places
