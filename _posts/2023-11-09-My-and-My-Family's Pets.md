My Pets
![Tummy, the fluffy grey cat](/The-Pet-Blog/IMG_3545(1).jpg)
Name: Tummy (past name Lulu)
Nicknames: Tummer, Floof, Murderfloof
Hobbies: Sleeping in my sock drawer, being annoyed at her new roommate Ronin
Adopted: From the Edmonton Humane Society as a kitten in 2012
What she means to me: She's been in my life for so long that I can't imagine being home without her, even if she is a crotchety old lady. She was my family's first cat, and showed me how amazing having cats can be.

Name: Ronin
Nicknames: Turkey boy, Mr. Boy, Mr. Cheesy Breadstick, Noodle guy
Hobbies: Chirping, knocking over his water dish in a frenzy, trying to play with his new best friend Tummy (and failing)
Adopted: August of this year, from the Edmonton Humane Society
What he means to me: He doubles the joy of having another creature in my small apartment, and is the first cat I've adopted myself, hopefully of many. Tummy sleeps everywhere and I appreciate her, and Ronin runs around and explores and makes sure I play with him all the time, making sure I notice he's here.
