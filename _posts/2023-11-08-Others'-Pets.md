Names: Poopy (past name Percy), Girly (past name Gertie), Crona
A little about them: Poopy is extremely orange, and apparently becomes more and less orange throughout the seasons. He's also a great example of orange boy-cat dumbness. Girly is a typical grey moody girl cat (like Tummy), but loves her other roommates, even if she won't admit it. Poopy is also her littermate, so they're both old siblings trying to keep up with the younger cat. Crona is the third cat, not related to the other two, but became fast friends with Poopy anyway. His face looks a little scaredy, hence being named after the anime character from Soul Eater, and his tail is very floofy. He loves to play with his human friend Aidan, and tries to play with Poopy a lot too, though Poopy can't usually keep up.

Crona from Soul Eater:
