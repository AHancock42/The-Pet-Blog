My friends', Melody and Aidan's, cats

Names: Poopy (previously Percy), Girly (previously Gertie), Crona
A little about them: Poopy is extremely orange, and apparently becomes more and less orange throughout the seasons. He's also a great example of orange boy-cat dumbness. Girly is a typical grey moody girl cat (like Tummy), but loves her other roommates, even if she won't admit it. Poopy is also her littermate, so they're both old siblings trying to keep up with the younger cat. Crona is the third cat, not related to the other two, but became fast friends with Poopy anyway. His face looks a little scaredy, hence being named after the anime character from Soul Eater, and his tail is very floofy. He loves to play with his human friend Aidan, and tries to play with Poopy a lot too, though Poopy can't usually keep up.

My friend Cat's cat
![Rosie, the friendly girl](/The-Pet-Blog/image000000.jpg)

Name: Rosie
A little about her: She's very friendly, though particular about visitors. She loves cuddling with her person and watching birds out the window, even though she lives in the city.

My (step)grandma's critters
![We'en, the friendly orange potato](/The-Pet-Blog/IMG_3556.jpg)![Scamper, the ferocious mother](/The-Pet-Blog/IMG_3558.jpg)![Bogo, the giant son](/The-Pet-Blog/IMG_3557.jpg)

Names: We'en (short for Hallowe'ener), Scamper, and Bogo (yes, **that** BOGO)
A little about them: We'en showed up at my grandma's house one day, cold and looking for food. They 'weren't going to keep him', but since he was cold they *had* to put him in the garage and... we all know how the story goes. After my grandma accepted that a lost critter wandering by her house was going to be adopted, Scamper wandered by her house, and was adopted! But the story doesn't end there; even though she was tiny and barely older than a kitten herself, a few days after they took her in, my grandma found her in a bag of yarn, having just given birth to a tiny black kitten! Thus Bogo was born, buy-one-get-one, eh?
