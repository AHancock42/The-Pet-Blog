Do you ever wonder about the hidden details that make people up that you don't know about? Not because they need to be secret, or they don't want to share, but just because they're small details that are part of their lives and are usually overlooked. Like, I've worked in cemeteries, I have six living grandparents, and I used to live in Thailand. You would never know to look at me, but all of these small details are important parts of my life. How often do we think about the hidden details of people's pets and how important they are to them? How and why they got them? What their silly nicknames are? That's what this site is about, knowing more about people's pets, and through them, the people. Also there are cute pet pictures.
